<section class="about">
    <h2>My Coding Journey</h2>
    <p>
        My journey into programming began at a young age when my father introduced me to the block-coding platform, <strong>Scratch</strong>. 
        I was immediately drawn to the creativity it allowed—building projects where I could see visual results from my logic. 
        The satisfaction of bringing ideas to life sparked an early interest in coding.
    </p>
    <p>
        In <strong>high school</strong>, my passion deepened when I enrolled in an <strong>Introduction to Programming</strong> course. 
        Here, I created a <strong>fully functional platforming game</strong>, reinforcing my love for problem-solving and design. 
        Motivated by that experience, I pursued <strong>AP Computer Science</strong> the following year, where I explored foundational programming concepts using <strong>Python</strong>. 
        This exposure to text-based coding broadened my understanding and piqued my curiosity about the possibilities within software development.
    </p>
    <p>
        After high school, I initially pursued <strong>Electrical Engineering</strong> at my local community college. 
        However, I found the path less aligned with my interests—especially the heavier math components. 
        Reflecting on what I truly enjoyed, I returned to the idea of programming. During this time, I collaborated with friends to create custom 
        <strong>Garry's Mod (GMod) servers</strong>, experimenting with <strong>Lua scripting</strong> to enhance gameplay. 
        Although my early scripting attempts were modest, the process deepened my intrigue in game development and coding.
    </p>
    <p>
        While completing my <strong>Associate of Science</strong> degree, I sought ways to solidify my programming skills. 
        This led me to take several introductory classes with <strong>We Can Code IT</strong>, giving me initial exposure to modern development concepts. 
        Realizing my passion, I enrolled in their <strong>Java Full-Stack Software Development Bootcamp</strong>. 
        The program was a transformative experience, introducing me to core industry practices and technologies like 
        <strong>Java, C#, SQL, JavaScript, React, and Spring Boot</strong>. 
        I learned how to approach development from a professional standpoint—writing clean, efficient code, and collaborating within agile workflows.
    </p>
    <p>
        After completing the bootcamp, I further expanded my skills by taking additional courses in <strong>C#, SQL, Data Analytics, and Cybersecurity</strong>, 
        strengthening my foundation for full-stack development.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, I'm working on a <strong>Warhammer 40K-inspired weapon pack for Garry's Mod</strong>. 
        This project has been an exciting blend of creative design and technical implementation, allowing me to push my Lua scripting skills while learning about balancing gameplay mechanics.
    </p>
    <p>
        Through every step of my journey, from simple block coding to complex software development projects, my passion for creating, problem-solving, and continuous learning has been my driving force. 
        I'm eager to apply this mindset to future projects and professional challenges.

<!-- Personal Projects & Interests Section -->
<section class="about">
    <h2>Beyond Code: Personal Projects & Interests</h2>

    <p>
        Outside of coding, I’m deeply passionate about creative projects that challenge me to think critically and explore new ideas.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I spend a lot of my free time developing custom content for <strong>Garry’s Mod (GMod)</strong>—whether it's crafting addons or designing and managing servers. 
        This work lets me experiment with <strong>Lua scripting</strong> while creating immersive gameplay experiences. 
        It’s a constant learning process that keeps me sharp and engaged.
    </p>

    <p>
        My love for storytelling is fueled by an interest in <strong>fantasy and science fiction</strong>. 
        I'm an avid listener of audiobooks and stories within these genres, often immersing myself in the interesting narratives while working on other tasks. 
        One of my biggest inspirations is the expansive lore of <strong>Warhammer 40K</strong>, which captivates me with its vast narrative freedom and intricate world-building.
    </p>

    <p>
        Roleplaying is another significant creative outlet. I’ve participated in numerous <strong>roleplaying games and servers</strong>, some of which have inspired deeper storytelling pursuits. 
        One of my personal projects is a <strong>fantasy novel</strong> I’ve been writing, centered around a character trapped within the chaotic dimension of the Warp. 
        The book is currently at <strong>50 chapters and over 200,000 words</strong>—it's quite exciting.
    </p>

    <p>
        I also enjoy experimenting with <strong>AI tools</strong>, exploring how they can assist me with coding, music production, and creative projects. 
        This curiosity has led me to create original music, which I share on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Shirikai" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>, blending creative writing with audio experimentation.
    </p>

    <p>
        On a more personal note, stepping into the professional world has been both exciting and challenging. 
        Having experienced <strong>severe anxiety</strong> throughout my life, it’s taken resilience and determination to push beyond comfort zones. 
        While it’s not always easy, I’m committed to growth, learning, and building connections that foster both personal and professional development.
    </p>
</section>


<!-- Looking Ahead Section -->
<section class="about">
    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

    <p>
        As I move forward in my career, my primary goal is to build a meaningful role within the field of <strong>software development</strong>—one that challenges me to solve complex problems, expand my skills, and contribute to innovative projects.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm eager to take my first professional steps, actively seeking opportunities that allow me to <strong>grow my portfolio, refine my abilities</strong>, and collaborate with experienced developers. 
        I thrive in environments that encourage learning and creative problem-solving, and I’m committed to continuously evolving as a developer.
    </p>

    <p>
        While my immediate focus is on establishing a strong foundation in software development, my long-term ambition is to transition into <strong>game development</strong>—an industry that merges my technical skills with my passion for creativity and interactive storytelling. 
        My experience with <strong>modding and developing for Garry’s Mod</strong> has already given me a glimpse into this world, and I’m excited to deepen that experience over time.
    </p>

    <p>
        Ultimately, I just want to find a role that not only keeps me engaged but also offers a stable environment where I can grow, contribute, and thrive. 
        I'm driven by curiosity, creativity, and the pursuit of impactful work, and I'm ready to bring that energy into the projects I undertake.
